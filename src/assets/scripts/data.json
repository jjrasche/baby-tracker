Big triggers for me are dying and missing out on experiences with you or regretting things I did wrong. Movies will of course get me going, but I particularly enjoy a good emotional book. I picked one in particular \"\"scar\"\", it starts with a punch I think the first line is \"\"My mother died yesterday\"\". The book is about the child's process of navigating death and really focuses on the responsibilities felt by that child. I think I started crying the first page :). Theo didn't really react much differently than any other book. Both kids were engaged while I read it. Charlie got a in her own head, her movements and reactions became slower like she was processing something. I looked at her and explained I expect to be with you for a very long time as long as you need me and often when you don't. This sadness seemed to track with her for a few minutes, but then went away. This isn't a new reaction from Charlie she will often separate herself when experiencing sadness, this most often happens when she did something wrong. It's like she's really considering the situation. I also gave my general \"\"feeling all the feels is important: speech.  Justine thought, and I kind of agree, that this book could do some damage early on so even though Charlie intentionally picked it out several times I started to nerf the content a lot.\",\"Jim\",\"Charlie\"\n2022-02-13 12:39,2022-02-13 12:39,\"Diary\",,,,\"Saying too when I say love you\",,\"Jim\",\"Charlie\"\n2022-02-13 10:53,2022-02-13 10:53,\"Diary\",,,,\"Convo\",\"J: Charlie I love you so much C: yah too\",\"Jim\",\"Charlie\"\n2022-02-13 10:25,2022-02-13 10:25,\"Diary\",,,,\"Viewpoint change\",\"I used to view kids as more of an obligation and not as much fun there's probably a lot of reasons for that but it affected my understanding of how other people would interact with them.   Like I tried to push Gigi out when she was done watching them after a full day because I assume she didn't want to be around them anymore because a larger part of me didn't want to be around them.  Now that I enjoy the majority of time I spend with you both I don't feel as bad about impromptu visits to Gigi's house or I don't take it as a personal insult when GG stays around after I get done with work I understand because I can empathize that I want to spend time with you.\",\"Jim\",\"Charlie\"\n2022-02-12 19:17,2022-02-12 19:17,\"Diary\",,,,\"demanding\",\"Charlie is being more stern when she wants something.

I notice it, but was confused for a second that it's actually happening. Like I had thought earlier today that I was surprised this hasn't happened in like 4-5 months, I had thought I was done with this happening, lol. But I rush Charlie out of the bath and she's nervous/sad because she suddenly went from bath time fun to out of bath without warning. I get out with Theo and put him in the shower, which he is loving cause he loves to squeegee the windows. Charlie's asks to poop on the potty, I think because she was nervous about me being irritated that kids were pooping where they shouldn't maybe, which is another sad sign about how much I show my irritation. This starts making more sense when I hear Charlie say multiple times \"\"it happens\"\", When she says this Charlie is looking up at me for confirmation that I understand pooping in the bath isn't a big deal. She does this several times with her arms held above her shoulders palms up shrugging. Which is cute that she knows the universal gesture for that saying. This was so disarming that I really took note of it as Charlie very often takes my and other's feelings into consideration. She has the visibility into peoples emotional state and has the concern and comfort needed to start calming a situation. I don't know how normal this is at such a young age, but I love it.\",\"Jim\",\"Charlie\"\n2022-02-12 07:26,2022-02-12 07:26,\"Diary\",,,,\"differences: playing make believe (charlie is much more advanced in playing make believe)\",\"During Bathtime we imrpovised make believe characters playing out a dynamic where the daddy brochiasorus(dad-brock) is the only dinosaur bath toy that can float and Theo was holding it. I tried to engage Theo in make believe by asking his daddy-brock to ferry across the trex-baby. I kept explaining that in several different ways, but Theo didn't pick up on it until I started being more direct like \"\"Theo take your big dinosaur and come over to the trex-baby so it can help move it from this side of the tub to the other\"\" and Theo started to interact. Charlie really wanted to play with us at this point so I gave her the babby-brok, she went up to Theo and tried to get the message across that it was Theos toy's baby, but Theo didn't get this. To appease Charlie who was starting to get frustrated at Theo not understanding. I took out the daddy trex and the baby one theo had previously helped ferry across the bath and started having them interact so Charlie and I just started playing a separate game where those two interacted. Charlie then tried to bring Theo into the game with us by using her baby-brok to call over his daddy-brok. After the both of us trying to explain what we were doing to Theo a couple times he started understanding and using his daddy-brok to interact with the baby-brok in a way that makes sense like saying high and it's ok to it. I then used daddy-trex to talk with Theo's daddy-brok I said  \t\tJ: \"\"we found your lost kid... we're glad you're ok\"\".  \t\tT: \"\"ok ... ok ...\"\"  \tAlthough, after bath Theo and I made believe we're trying to hide from something --> Theo was very good at pretending and improv. So seems like he plays in a more tactile/emotional thinker than his sister who like to have character interactions and games\",\"Jim\",\"Charlie\"\n2022-02-9 19:20,2022-02-9 19:20,\"Diary\",,,,\"Fake bite\",\"Charlie just fake bit theos butt and they both laughed\",\"Jim\",\"Charlie\"\n2022-02-9 08:09,2022-02-9 08:09,\"Diary\",,,,\"Started saying I love Daddy so much\",,\"Jim\",\"Charlie\"\n2022-02-7 11:21,2022-02-7 11:21,\"Diary\",,,,\"Pretending to be puppies a lot\",,\"Jim\",\"Charlie\"\n2022-02-7 10:26,2022-02-7 10:26,\"Diary\",,,,\"So independent!\",\"Today while we were playing in the basement Charlie noticed she had a hole in her pajama pants. She walked over to the door and said be right back… Two minutes… Need new pants… Be back two minutes.  I knew she was going up to her bedroom to get some new pants to put on. So I pulled her up on her camera. She could not turn on the bedroom light to see the pants in the drawer. She walked over to the closet and turned on the light switch but didn’t open the door. Then she said can’t do it… She looked around and went over to her little mirror and stool. She grabbed the stool put it underneath the ceiling fan and stepped up on it. Looked up at the ceiling fan string that turns on the light and said can’t reach. Then she got down the stool and said need help. She started to walk out of the bedroom door and I turn on the microphone to talk to her. I called her back Jan and told her to open her closet door and turn the light so she can see her pants. I asked her if she could hear me to say hello. She said hello! Then she saw pink heart overalls in the closet and wanted to wear those but could not get them down. She came out of the closet and said need help! Looking at the camera.

There was a little meltdown in the cafeteria of Costco where Charlie wanted to hold the ice cream and I didn't want her to hold it until it wasn't overflowing. So she cried under the table for 5 minutes until she probably got up and said pee pee.  Lady across from us said she would watch her stuff and I ran with everything that couldn't be replaced to the bathroom. Holding both kids brought them into a single stall as all the stalls were taken. I took off Charlie's shirt then her tutu then her pants then her underwear and she sat down the toilet like it was nothing went pee and was great she did start looking under the stall walls at the other people pooping I assume which I had to discourage.  Got back to the table everything was still there and I was able to coax Charlie out of under the table crying again to feed her a couple of bites of the ice cream then let her have it as it was less messy at that point and she's really good eating ice cream.  As I talk to text this story Charlie I said shopping? And then crying?

She is really good at kicking and kicked from one side of the pool to the other multiple times. It's also nice to see her relaxed enough in the water to lie in her back for a full minute. Charlie even made a floating ship out of the letter floaties and put some duck toys on top of it\",\"Jim\",\"Charlie\"\n2022-01-19 22:30,2022-01-19 22:30,\"Diary\",,,,\"Saying I love you regularly\",\"Charlie will often say to Theo before going to bed.

But Theo starting to take more subtle cues from her too.  As I open the door to the garage to load them in the car to go to the museum with Papa and Granny. Charlie started inching back. She has some hesitancy towards the cold, but I think this is mostly becoming game. Theo noticed her moving backwards and started to move backwards with her. This is of no because I've usually been able to coax Theo into the garage, but not this time.   They both inch backwards for probably 15 ft until they turned and ran in both hid in the castle they were there for probably 30 seconds just calmly talking to each other before I came in and got them\",\"Jim\",\"Charlie\"\n2022-01-17 09:59,2022-01-17 09:59,\"Diary\",,,,\"Refuse a call to adventure\",\"I was putting on Charlie's shoes as she was totally engrossed in this bubble popping toy and I said in my best Bilbo baggins voice we're going on an adventure.

Charlie heard this and went back into the master bedroom to double check that there was no mommy there and she knew she left 15 minutes before. Charlie came out and said to feel no Mommy here.  Try single little hesitant to come downstairs until I said he was crying he needs us and then she started walking down the stairs saying help help. As in she was going to help Theo.  We got downstairs and Charlie was explaining to Theo mommy gone daddy day.

I'm more interested and perceptive. I'm more creative and playful. That perceptiveness is two-sided as I get nervous easily like Charlie introducing a new behavior of saying \"\"tummy hurts\"\" when she means to say I'm hungry. So now it's hard to distinguish when she's sick and needs help or just needs some food. So when she starts saying tummy hurts starting at 7pm and eats a piece and a half of jam toast and goes down with mommy to eat more, and even with all that continues saying tummy hurts I'm more likely to think we should call an urgent care rather than maybe she just was hungry ate too much and then her stomach is painfully distended.   But on the positive side I am able to create a pseudo imaginary friend situation out of us all interacting with the moon and becoming friends and then putting to bed.   I read a robot destroys the town comic style book with Charlie and added the sound effects and cinematic voices in. I linger longer on the pages of a book, asking/answering questions, or pointing out details I notice and suggesting she do the same.    \",\"Jim\",\"Charlie\"\n2022-01-16 16:57,2022-01-16 16:57,\"Diary\",,,,\"Feelings about being a dad right now\",\"I think I'm a good dad but I have a lot of personality traits that make it harder than it should be.

We had a blast at the Museum. Theo consoled Charlie after she realized she couldn't get into the staged ice cream truck. Charlie laid down in this foot step of the vehicle and felt sad for a bit, and Theo kept saying \"\"Sorry Charlie\"\" and rubbing her back until she got up 30 seconds later.   We looked at the fox exhibit where I pointed out bird wings on the ground from a meal they had earlier and Charlie felt pretty bad about that saying \"\"no, no no don't eat.\"\" to the stuffed foxes.   Charlie played with he shadow in a darkened room with projected ceiling lights resembling water.   We spent 10 minutes at the marshland exhibit pressing the bird and frog sound buttons and pointing out different animals we saw.   At the treehouse are Theo gathered all of the puppets and put on a little one man show. While Charlie climbed the steep stairs with a book and asked for \"\"Theo come house read book\"\" a couple times, but he was pretend sleeping with the puppets under the treehouse.   All 3 of us eliminated waste at the bathroom where I put on llama llama for a couple minutes to do some toddler crowd control. I left my jacket in trying to manage everyone and no one complained as we dodged the ticket line and road the elevator back up and down to get it.   Theo was very into the drawers containing bugs and such and pulled them all out and used a magnifying glass (probably not well) to view some of the items. He pushed all the drawers in when he was done.   We had apple sauce and cheerios on the ride home and everyone braved the cold and had patience in the car so well. I just felt like we were all communicating and enjoying each others company.   You both went down for naps, but I had to come back upstairs after mom put you down Charlie b/c you wanted me to sing you to sleep. I'm thinking of learning the lyrics of a song a work day so I can have a nice little repertoire to sing to you as I am really struggling to remember songs in the moment as I put you to bed. You've heard rodeo like 30 times by now. Theo woke up in just the perfect mood. He cried for like 2 seconds, but was clingy for a couple minutes until he just became excited and wanted to play.  We went to the library, then Costco. It was a little colder as the sun was setting, but you both handled the cold on your faces and hands for the 50 yards to the door very well. We ate Costco pizza for dinner. We turned the music up and rolled the back window down as you yelled high and waved at all the people walking by. I had so much fun in that car just watching you both enjoying life.  We agreed that we would finish the Encanto movie and eat popcorn when we got home. Charlie is getting a pretty good memory for things said, b/c she remembered I said we were going to costco after the library and that we were watching a movie with popcorn after we got home.     \",\"Jim\",\"Charlie\"\n2022-01-9 20:21,2022-01-9 20:21,\"Diary\",,,,\"emotional overload\",\"From my 33 years of observation I can safely say... I am an emotional person. I often say I want to feel \"\"all the feels\"\". There's a 90% chance I'm going to cry at any given Children's movie and us watching Encanto together was not an exception.   I empathized with the father of the triplets who died defending his wife and newborn children from violence. Reconciling the idea that I wouldn't have you all, my wonderful family, got to me and I had a 30 min emotional breakdown. Crying, laughing, hugging, kissing, dancing and listening to love songs to steer right into these emotions I released all of my oxytocin. I danced with Charlie, twirling around and imaging you grown up. I am going to lose it if I walk you down the isle, not gonna be pretty. Hell, I'm gonna be a very sappy crying dad so get over it :). I kept asking Theo to tackle me and we would do hugging rolls and kiss tickles. Mom and we danced to a couple songs all together just enjoying the family togetherness. For some of that time I just sat there watching you play with trains or something normal and just so unbelievably happy I get to experience you both. \",\"Jim\",\"Charlie\"\n2022-01-8 12:09,2022-01-8 12:09,\"Diary\",,,,\"Loves her watch\",\"Did you did a toy swap a couple days ago and they found this watch Charlie has been very focused on it as one of her favorite toys she even probably accidentally set an alarm on it\",\"Jim\",\"Charlie\"\n2022-01-3 20:06,2022-01-3 20:06,\"Diary\",,,,\"New bedtime behavior\",\"Def trying to delay bedtime longer.

Charlie's able to talk about her feelings a little better than Theo so I asked her yesterday why was she crying. We walked through a couple of motions and we landed on sad but I didn't get a real good reason for why she was sad maybe it's a bad dream\",\"Jim\",\"Charlie\"\n2022-01-3 08:51,2022-01-3 08:51,\"Diary\",,,,\"Discovered treasure trove\",\"Charlie surprised herself when she opened up the trunk of her tricycle to find a bunch of treasures\",\"Jim\",\"Charlie\"\n2022-01-3 08:37,2022-01-3 08:37,\"Diary\",,,,\"Gummy dictates\",\"All three of us were reading a book after breakfast a really good breakfast actually eggs that Charlie helped make tomatoes mandarin orange and bread kids both a pretty well we made a game up about the shape of their bread after a couple bites looking like a tiger and attacking the egg so we have to keep the eggs safe in our mouth.  Anyway reading that book Charlie out of the blue said gummies which refers to the gummy vitamins they get every morning. Gigi is much better at remembering this than mom or dad. So I said yeah of course thanks for reminding me. So Charlie jumped off the recliner ran to the cabinet where we keep the gummies waiting for me to open them feel also ran when Charlie got to the cabinet she yelled purple purple referring to wanting a purple gummy pretty sure they all taste the same but they're very few purple ones.

Theo was standing next to the pile unaware of it. So I scooped him up as he has picked up and thrown pennies droppings in the past. I bring charlie to the changing table, realizing it's close enough to nap time that I should put a 6 on her and those are only upstairs. Both kids are still naked and I push Charlie out the gate to walk up the stairs. I find Theo at the other gate right above a puddle of piss.   I throw some paper towels on it and rush Theo to the stairs to help both kids into a room. I start to change Charlie's diaper when the lights go out... Theo is now making a game of turning off the lights making it pitch black in a room where I am losing control of two naked toddlers. The game of let's be in the dark continues for a couple more minutes amidst several more unsuccessful attempts to change diapers.  I get them into diapers and Charlie finds and starts unrolling half a roll of tape I was thinking could be used to secure the light switches.

Some common things she'll want that we don't give in to is food while we're shopping, food right before bed, something that will cause a big mess or something brother is currently playing with.

She removed most of the fun stuff and incentives to get out of bed. Took off a side from Theo's crib and put up a bumper that gave him enough space to get out but prevented him from falling out accidentally.  Moved everything out of the office and cleaned it, setup Charlie's crib. Changed around all the cameras. Went to the store to buy another baby monitor and sound machine. What a herculean effort.   The first night sleeping separate, we got Charlie really excited about her new \"\"big girl\"\" purple room and it worked. She very much wanted to sleep in that room. She cried out for brother a couple of times but fell asleep within a half hour.  Theo took a fairly long time to get to sleep, maybe a full hour, but he never left the bed. Since then he has gotten up at his normal 6:20ish in the morning and quitely crawled around to the door and back until 7:30.

A couple of minutes later the boy went over to try and take the dump truck from Charlie. Theodore went over and gently put his hand on the boys hand and said share, share, share. The boy looked at him and then let go of the dump truck and turned to play. I asked Charlie to tell the boys thank you and she did sign language for thank you. This reminded me so much of an incident When Jim and Justine were little. And the after school program a boy took a toy from Ashley, Jim took the boy by the arm over to one of the workers and said he took this toy from my sister.

Sunday night and Monday night I stayed up with her Sunday was the first time that we actually co-slept where I tried to let her sleep in a crib in the basement to not disturb brother but she would cry out maybe once every 10 minutes she was pretty congested so probably that prevented for her from sleeping.   But she slept for maybe an hour and a half on me while incline so she could breathe more easily. She also slept next to me on a cushion with a pillow that was pretty cute but only lasted for maybe a couple minutes.  She was a little confused about being up in the dim light during the night but she played a little bit she brought her bumblebee car downstairs he was very adamant about that most of the time she just like rolled around me trying to sleep.  It hasn't been easy to get medicine and Charlie it's kind of funny at the first urgent Care the nurse said she never seen a kid take medicine that easily and honestly it was but it was the only time we had during that stent.

I setup the hatch sound machine to change sound to \"\"birds chirping\"\" and a green light at 7:30. So this was the first morning the kids woke up to that. I paused for 10 seconds before walking in. Both kids we very curious, with Theo being a little cautious about it.   We came downstairs in sleepers, neither had peed that much during the night. Charlie asked to turn the sound machine off. Both kids brought their lovies downstairs with them. I had steamed carrots ready and Charlie ate a couple while taking the lid on and off. She chased brother a couple steps as he ran away from her trying to feed him carrots. A little bit later Charlie changed tactics and placed a carrot on that table in front of him and Theo ate it before spitting most of it out a minute later.  We played with babies in strollers, cars and toys for 15 minutes. Charlie and Theo both drank a green tea I poured into their small cups. Charlie posed for a photo with me. She was smiling and we both held up our cups. She's saying cheese now in response to getting photos taken.  For breakfast Theo ate everything on his plate (eggs, fiber one cereal bits, mandarin orange, carrot) and got some of sisters oranges and eggs. Charlie has gotten in the habit of drinking a decent amount of dads veggie smoothie (spinach, celery, keifer, skyr, blue berries, inulin powder). I give her frozen chunks initially and sometimes I'll give her the cup when there's only a little left and she'll drink it straight.

Theodore seems to have much more patience, used to be when he was pushing a toy and it would get stuck at the edge of the carpet or a wall he would start crying out. He was pushing the did activity box around the kitchen and when he got to the carpets edge just kept trying until he got it moving a different direction.  They are both battling so much.

Took about 5-10 min of watching her but she eventually went back to sleep. \",\"Justine\",\"Charlie\"\n2020-02-12 02:59,2020-02-12 02:59,\"Diaper\",,,\"BM+Wet\",\"Charlie had a BM and wet Diaper (small)\",,\"Jim\",\"Charlie\"\n2020-02-12 00:06,2020-02-12 02:54,\"Sleep\",168,,,\"Charlie slept (2h48m)\",,\"Jim\",\"Charlie\"\n2020-02-11 23:52,2020-02-12 00:04,\"Bottle\",12,100.0,\"Formula\",\"Charlie drank 100 ml of formula (12m)\",,\"Jim\",\"Charlie\"\n2020-02-11 23:50,2020-02-11 23:50,\"Diaper\",,,\"BM+Wet\",\"Charlie had a BM and wet Diaper (medium)\",\"Crying and uncomfortable even after diaper change\",\"Jim\",\"Charlie\"\n2020-02-11 18:51,2020-02-11 23:45,\"Sleep\",294,,,\"Charlie slept (4h54m)\",,\"Jim\",\"Charlie\"\n2020-02-11 18:42,2020-02-11 18:47,\"Bottle\",5,60.0,\"Formula\",\"Charlie drank 60 ml of formula (5m)\",,\"Justine\",\"Charlie\"\n2020-02-11 17:47,2020-02-11 18:01,\"Bottle\",11,180.0,\"Formula\",\"Charlie drank 180 ml of formula (11m)\",,\"Jim\",\"Charlie\"\n2020-02-11 17:10,2020-02-11 17:10,\"Diaper\",,,\"BM+Wet\",\"Charlie had a BM and wet Diaper (small)\",,\"Jim\",\"Charlie\"\n2020-02-11 15:38,2020-02-11 16:07,\"Sleep\",30,,,\"Charlie slept (30m)\",,\"Karen\",\"Charlie\"\n2020-02-11 14:44,2020-02-11 14:59,\"Bottle\",12,170.0,\"Formula\",\"Charlie drank 170 ml of formula (12m)\",,\"Karen\",\"Charlie\"\n2020-02-11 14:21,2020-02-11 14:21,\"Activity\",,,,\"Charlie is having a bath\",,\"Karen\",\"Charlie\"\n2020-02-11 14:15,2020-02-11 14:15,\"Diaper\",,,\"BM+Wet\",\"Charlie had a poopy and wet diaper (leak, large, watery)\",,\"Karen\",\"Charlie\"\n2020-02-11 11:51,2020-02-11 13:57,\"Sleep\",126,,,\"Charlie slept (2h06m)\",,\"Karen\",\"Charlie\"\n2020-02-11 11:37,2020-02-11 11:48,\"Bottle\",11,175.0,\"Formula\",\"Charlie drank 175 ml of formula (11m)\",,\"Karen\",\"Charlie\"\n2020-02-11 10:34,2020-02-11 10:34,\"Diaper\",,,\"BM+Wet\",\"Charlie had a poopy and wet diaper (diaper cream, small, watery)\",,\"Karen\",\"Charlie\"\n2020-02-11 09:26,2020-02-11 10:06,\"Sleep\",40,,,\"Charlie slept (40m)\",,\"Karen\",\"Charlie\"\n2020-02-11 09:16,2020-02-11 09:16,\"Diaper\",,,\"BM+Wet\",\"Charlie had a poopy and wet diaper (diaper cream, small, watery)\",,\"Karen\",\"Charlie\"\n2020-02-11 08:24,2020-02-11 08:45,\"Bottle\",15,170.0,\"Formula\",\"Charlie drank 170 ml of formula (15m)\",,\"Karen\",\"Charlie\"\n2020-02-11 06:50,2020-02-11 07:27,\"Sleep\",36,,,\"Charlie slept (36m)\",,\"Jim\",\"Charlie\"\n2020-02-11 06:04,2020-02-11 06:45,\"Sleep\",40,,,\"Charlie slept (40m)\",,\"Justine\",\"Charlie\"\n2020-02-11 06:04,2020-02-11 06:04,\"Diary\",,,,\"Falling asleep on floor\",\"She was falling asleep on the floor, so I threw the schedule out the window and put her in the crib.
